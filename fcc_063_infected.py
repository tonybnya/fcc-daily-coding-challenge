Description : Infected
Author      : @tonybnya

On November 2nd, 1988, the first major internet worm was released,
infecting about 10% of computers connected to the internet after only a day.

In this challenge, you are given a number of days that have passed since
an internet worm was released, and you need to determine how many computers
are infected using the following rules:

- On day 0, the first computer is infected.
- Each subsequent day, the number of infected computers doubles.
- Every 3rd day, a patch is applied after the virus spreads and reduces
  the number of infected computers by 20%.
  Round the number of patched computers up to the nearest whole number.

For example, on:

- Day 0: 1 total computer is infected.
- Day 1: 2 total computers are infected.
- Day 2: 4 total computers are infected.
- Day 3: 8 total computers are infected.
  Then, apply the patch: 8 infected * 20% = 1.6 patched.
  Round 1.6 up to 2. 8 computers infected - 2 patched = 6 total computers infected after day 3.

Return the number of total infected computers after the given amount of days have passed.
