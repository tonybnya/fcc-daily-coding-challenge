Given an integer representing the number of candles you start with, and an integer representing how many burned candles it takes to create a new one, return the number of candles you will have used after creating and burning as many as you can.

For example, if given 7 candles and it takes 2 burned candles to make a new one:

1. Burn 7 candles to get 7 leftovers,
2. Recycle 6 leftovers into 3 new candles (1 leftover remains),
3. Burn 3 candles to get 3 more leftovers (4 total),
4. Recycle 4 leftovers into 2 new candles,
5. Burn 2 candles to get 2 leftovers,
6. Recycle 2 leftovers into 1 new candle,
7. Burn 1 candle.

You will have burned 13 total candles in the example.
